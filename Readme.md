**Kratos - Evolutionary algorithm Framework with operator chaining**

Kratos is a project which provides a framework with chaining operator for evolutionary algorithms. 
I choose this name because this framework would provides rules for implementing flexible evolutionary algorithms.

Indeed, Wikipedia said that Kratos is the son of Pallas and Styx and the personification of strength, might, sovereign rule, and authority in all its forms.

Planned features: 
   - Framework to help design in the design of evolutionary algorithms
   - Chaining of the components of evolutionary algorithms via operators
   - Provide linear constraints
   - Tools for monitoring algorithms
