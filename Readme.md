Kratos is a project which provides a framework with chaining operator for evolutionary algorithms. 
I choose this name because this framework would provides rules for implementing flexible evolutionary algorithms.

Indeed, Wikipedia said that Kratos is the son of Pallas and Styx and the personification of strength, might, sovereign rule, and authority in all its forms.
